  Reminisce is a Rust library for detecting gamepads / joysticks and reading
  input from them non-blockingly, without any external C dependencies. It does
  this by using the native platform's raw Joystick API to detect and poll
  joystickks.
baseurl: "/reminisce/" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog/
